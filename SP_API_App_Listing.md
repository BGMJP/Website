## 2. App Long Description (Max 3000 characters)

This application generates a unified weekly performance dashboard for Amazon businesses by consolidating data across advertising, inventory, customer service and returns.

It reads structured operational data (such as ads performance, FBA/FBM inventory, Voice of Customer, seller feedback, reviews and 30‑day returns) and automatically produces:
- Interactive HTML dashboards for internal meetings
- Per‑brand and per‑country reports with KPIs and charts
- Archived CSV snapshots for audits and historical analysis

The app is designed for brands, aggregators and agencies that manage multiple Amazon accounts and marketplaces. It standardizes input files into a consistent schema, cleans and normalizes headers (including mixed English/Korean columns), and safely handles missing or noisy data.

Key output includes:
- Weekly ads KPIs (Ad Spend, Ad Sales, Total Sales, ACOS, TACoS, CTR, CVR)
- Product‑level advertising performance
- Inventory health and aging summary, including long‑term storage exposure
- Customer service metrics (seller feedback, VoC tickets, reviews, returns)
- Internal dashboard summarizing all brands and countries for quick comparison

The generated dashboard focuses on usability for recurring internal meetings: it highlights important changes week‑over‑week, provides clear visuals (charts and tables), and keeps a clean layout suitable for screen‑sharing or exporting.

This tool is intended to sit behind the scenes as an internal analytics utility. It does not perform any account management actions; it only reads structured data, calculates metrics and renders reports.
